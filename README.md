# CatFacts

This project was made to help beginners learn Angular with a simple web application going through many basic things like:
- Angular CLI
- HttpClient
- Angular Material
- Services
- *ngIf
- *ngFor
- Observables

Thanks to this, they have the basics to build a real Angular app and the discover more lateral knowledge.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
